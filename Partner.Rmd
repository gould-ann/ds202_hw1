## Owner's Recent Commit Objective + Id
On the most recent commit Bj99fay added supplementary files to support his submission of HW1.
The Commit ID: 30fd36d3bde4c1913ddc4077b60df4047d2a122b

## Knit Owners hw1.Rmd?
bj99fay's hw1.Rmd knits. All of the information is present and the file is embedded effectively.

## Difficulty or Suggestion?
I encountered no issues while trying to clone or pull bj99fay's data science repository. I would make it clear what sorts of errors may be encountered when working with clones of remote repositories.
